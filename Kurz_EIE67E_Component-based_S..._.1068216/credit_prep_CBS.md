Credit exam prep — Component-based Software (10 days)

Goal: pass credit test (likely MCQ + short questions). Focus: C# syntax, object paradigm, patterns, unit testing basics.

Key local resources:
- Lecture slides: `Soubor_Course_Introduction_.1068234/content/lecture00_2023.pptx`, `Soubor_C_Language_Part_*.pptx`, `Soubor_Unit_testing_and_refac..._.1068257` (lecture11)
- Test: `Test_Semestral_Credit_Test_.1068233/index.html` (practice)

10-day plan:
Day 1: Course overview and OOP concepts (classes, objects, encapsulation). Read lecture01.
Day 2: C# syntax basics (types, control flow) — read lecture02.
Day 3: Methods, collections, LINQ basics (lecture06)
Day 4: Exception handling, debugging, Visual Studio basics
Day 5: Design patterns overview (lecture09/lecture10)
Day 6: Unit testing & refactoring (lecture11)
Day 7: Practical code reading: open sample projects in the folder (Calculators, CowOnTheRun)
Day 8: Timed practice on `Test_Semestral_Credit_Test_` and sample MCQs
Day 9: Work through selected sample exercises and solutions
Day 10: Mock credit test + review

I can: extract slides and create 30 MCQs covering syntax and patterns; produce short code snippets for quick practice.
