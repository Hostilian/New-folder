Applied Mathematics — 2-week exam study plan (3 hours/day)

Assumption: 3 hours per day available. Goal: cover all high-priority topics and finish with 2 full-length mock written exams + oral prep.

Week 1 (foundations, 3 h/day)
Day 1: Linear algebra revision (1.5h) — vector spaces, bases, rank. Problem practice (1.5h) from `SQ11`.
Day 2: Linear systems & Gaussian elimination (1.5h) — practice 3 problems; (1.5h) short theory Qs.
Day 3: Matrices & determinants (1.5h); inverse and applications (1.5h).
Day 4: Linear programming introduction (1.5h) — simplex idea, standard form; (1.5h) small simplex problems.
Day 5: Duality & sensitivity (1.5h) — weak/strong duality; (1.5h) problem set.
Day 6: Transportation problems & Vogel/MODI (3h) — Seminars 9 & 10 materials; run full MODI check.
Day 7: Game theory basics & mixed strategies (3h) — `SQ10.md` and P9 slides; work 2 solved examples.

Week 2 (applications, mocks, oral prep)
Day 8: Decision analysis & decision trees (1.5h); EMV/EOL/EOL computations (1.5h).
Day 9: Multiple criteria (AHP) (3h) — compute priorities and CR for a 3×3 matrix.
Day 10: Full mock exam 1 (2h) + 1h review of mistakes (use `AMI_mock_exam_1_full.md`).
Day 11: Seminar problems deep-dive (3h) — seminar 9 routing and seminar 12 decision models.
Day 12: Full mock exam 2 (2h) + 1h review (I'll create Mock 2). 
Day 13: Oral prep (3h) — summarize short answers for theory Q1–Q6 from `SQ10-12`.
Day 14: Final quick review (3h) — cheat-sheet, 30 min MCQ warm-up, rest and exam readiness.

Materials to use every day: cheatsheet (`AMI_cheatsheet_onepage.md`), extracted plain study questions, lecture slides (P1,P3,P8-P12), seminar spreadsheets and solutions.

Notes: I will produce Mock Exam 2 next and a set of 30 MCQs for timed credit practice. Tell me if you want those MCQs in Moodle CSV format.
