A 
company
 
engaged
 in 
the
 
production
 
of
 
sets
 
for
 
mastering
 basic 
operations
 
with
 SMD 
components
 
can
 
produce
 
three
 
variants
 
of
 
sets
 (A, B, 
C - 
see
 
assignment
 
of
 past 
exercises
).
This
 
time
, 
the
 
company
 
is
 in a 
situation
 
where
 
it
 has to make a 
decision
 
about
 
which
 
types
 
of
 
sets
 to 
produce
 and 
offer
 to 
high
 
schools
 and 
universities
 
of
 
electrical
 
fields
 and 
fields
 
focused
 on 
industrial
 
automation
, 
given
 
the
 market 
situation
. 
However
, 
the
 
situation
 in 
the
 market 
for
 these 
teaching
 
sets
 
is
 
uncertain
, so 
the
 
demand
 
for
 these 
products
 
can
 
range
 
from
 very 
low
, 
through
 medium to very 
high
.
Estimated
 sales (in 
millions
 
of
 CZK) 
for
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
teaching
 
sets
, 
depending
 on 
demand
, are 
shown
 in 
the

The
 
average
 
production
 
cost
 
of
 
one
 set 
of
 any 
kind
 
is
 0.1 
million
 CZK. 
If
 
the
 
company
 
wants
 to 
produce
 
two
 
types
 
of
 
sets
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
, 
it
 has to 
invest
 and 
expand
 
the
 
production
 line, and 
therefore
 
the
 
average
 
production
 
costs
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
types
 
of
 
sets
 are CZK 0.4 
million
. 
If
 
the
 
company
 
decides
 to 
produce
 
all
 
types
 
of
 
sets
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
, 
it
 
must
 build 
new
 
production
 
premises
, and 
therefore
, 
after
 
accounting
 
for
 
additional
 
costs
, 
the
 
average
 
production
 
costs
 
for
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
all
 
three
 
types
 
of
 
sets
 are 1 
million
 CZK
.
Part 
A
 
Tasks
 and 
questions
:
1) 
Define
 a set 
of
 
alternatives
.
2) 
Define
 a set 
of
 
states
 
of
 
nature
.
3) Build a 
payoff
 matrix.
4) Build a 
decision
 
tree
.
5) 
Assess
 
the
 dominance 
of
 
individual
 
alternatives
 (
according
 to 
payouts
, 
according
 to 
the
 
state
 
of
 
nature
, 
according
 to 
probability - risk
 profile, 
fill
 in 
the
 
missing
 data 
yourself
).
Part 
B
Tasks
 and 
questions
:
1) 
Decide
 
what
 
types
 
of
 
sets
 (
or
 
their
 
combination
) to 
produce
 in 
the
 case 
of
 
decisions
 
based
 on 
certainty
, 
uncertainty
 and risk (
fill
 in 
the
 
missing
 data 
yourself
).
2) Interpret and 
compare
 
the
 
achieved
 
results
.
