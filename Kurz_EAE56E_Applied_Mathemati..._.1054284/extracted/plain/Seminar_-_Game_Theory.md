1 – 
Competitive
 game
The
 
company
 
engaged
 in 
the
 
production
 
of
 
teaching
 
sets
 
for
 
high
 
schools
 and 
universities
 in 
electrical
 
fields
 and 
fields
 
focused
 on 
industrial
 
automation
 
produces
 
educational
 
sets
 
of
 
electronic
 
components
, 
which
 
also
 
includes
 a set 
for
 
mastering
 basic 
operations
 
with
 SMD 
components
. 
The
 
company
 
can
 
produce
 
three
 
variants
 (A, B, C) 
of
 
sets
 
for
 
mounting
 SMD 
components
 (
see
 
assignment
 
of
 past 
exercises
).
However
, 
there
 
is
 
another
 
competing
 
company
 
operating
 on 
the
 market 
producing
 
similar
 
sets
, 
differing
 in 
the
 
thickness
 
of
 
the
 
copper
 
foil
 on 
the
 
laminate
 
printed
 
circuit
 
board
. 
Schools
 use 
teaching
 
sets
 
from
 
both
 
companies
, 
while
 
teaching
 
sets
 
from
 
individual
 
companies
 are 
completely
 
interchangeable
 
for
 
teaching
 
needs
. 
The
 
purchase
 
of
 
teaching
 
sets
 
is
 
then
 limited by 
the
 
budgetary
 
resources
 
of
 
individual
 
schools
, 
together
 
they
 are 
willing
 to 
spend
 1 
million
 CZK 
for
 
each
 type 
of
 
teaching
 set.
Schools
 
prefer
 
different
 
types
 
of
 learning 
kits
 
for
 
their
 
teaching
, so 
the
 
company
 
decides
 
which
 
kits
 to 
produce
 and 
offer
 to 
schools
 in 
order
 to 
get
 
the
 
highest
 sales, but 
it
 has to 
take
 
into
 
account
 
its
 
competitive
 rival.
If
 
the
 
company
 
offers
 
the
 
specific
 type 
of
 
teaching
 set
 as 
the
 
only
 
competitor
 on 
the
 market
, 
it
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
only
 
one
 to 
receive
 
the
 
entire
 
budgetary
 
funds
 
of
 
the
 
schools
, but 
if
 
both
 
companies
 
offer
 
the
 
given
 set, 
they
 
will
 
divide
 
the
 CZK 1 
million
 in 
half
.
The
 
production
 
costs
 to 
cover
 
the
 
demand
 
of
 any set 
amount
 to 0.1 
million
 CZK. 
If
 a 
company
 (
or
 
companies
) 
wants
 to 
produce
 
two
 
sets
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
, 
it
 
must
 
expand
 
the
 
production
 line, and 
therefore
 
the
 
average
 
production
 
cost
 to 
cover
 
the
 
demand
 
for
 
two
 
sets
 
is
 0.4 
million
 CZK. 
If
 
the
 
company
 
decides
 to 
produce
 
all
 
sets
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
, 
it
 
must
 build a 
new
 
production
 
space
, and 
therefore
, 
after
 
accounting
 
for
 
additional
 
costs
, 
the
 
average
 
production
 
costs
 
for
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
all
 
three
 
sets
 are CZK 1 
million
.
Questions
:
 
1) 
Define
 
the
 set 
of
 
players
.
2) 
Determine
 
the
 
strategy
 
options
 
of
 
all
 
players
.
3) Build a 
pay
off
 matrix 
for
 
each
 
player
;
 
the
 
pay
off
 
is
 profit.
4) 
Construct
 a
 
payoff
 matrix 
for
 
first
 
player
; 
the
 
payoff
 
is
 by 
how
 much more 
payoff
 he 
makes
5) 
What
 type 
of
 game 
is
 
it
?
6) 
Find
 and interpret 
the
 
optimal
 
solution
.
Part B
The
 
change
 in 
the
 
situation
 
consists
 in 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 second 
company
 
does
 not 
have
 any 
available
 
land
 
for
 
the
 
expansion
 
of
 
production
 
premises
 and 
therefore
 has to 
invest
 in 
new
 
construction
 
plots
, and 
therefore
 
the
 
average
 
production
 
costs
 
for
 
the
 
production
 
of
 
all
 
three
 
types
 
of
 
sets
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
 
amount
 to 1.5 
million
 CZK.
2 – 
Competition
 
with
 a 
new
 set
The
 
company
 
plans
 to 
offer
 
its
 
teaching
 
sets
 A, B, C 
also
 on 
the
 
foreign
 market in Slovakia, by 
producing
 and 
supplying
 
either
 just 
one
 pair 
of
 
sets
, 
or
 
all
 
three
 
types
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
. 
Before
 
deciding
 
what
 
types
 
of
 
kits
 to 
produce
, 
the
 
company
 has done market 
research
 and 
found
 
one
 
relevant
 
competitor
 
that
 
is
 
able
 to 
offer
 
kits
 A, B, C, D
 and 
it
 
will
  
supply
 
the
 market 
with
 
kits
 
of
 
two
 
types
. 
Based
 on 
the
 market 
analysis
, 
the
 
company
 
was
 
able
 to 
compile
 
the
 
following
 
pay
 matrix (
this
 
is
 profit):
