A 
company
 
engaged
 in 
the
 
production
 
of
 
sets
 
for
 
mastering
 basic 
operations
 
with
 SMD 
components
 
can
 
produce
 
three
 
types
 
of
 
sets
 (A, B, C - 
see
 
assignment
 
of
 past 
exercises
).
This
 
time
, 
the
 
company
 
is
 in a 
situation
 
where
 
it
 has to make a 
decision
, 
which
 
production
 set
 
to cho
ose, and 
thanks
 to 
the
 
analysis
 
of
 
production
 and 
the
 market environment, 
it
 has 
evaluated
 
individual
 
variants
 
of
 
production
 
using
 5 
essential
 
criteria
, 
which
 are: 
production
 
costs
, 
revenues
, 
average
 
production
 speed, 
average
 
production
 
defect
 
rate
 and 
customer
 
satisfaction
. 
The
 
criterion
 matrix 
for
 
evaluating
 
production
 
variants
 
according
 to 
the
 
above
 
criteria
 
is
 
shown
 in 
the
 
following
 table:

all
 
qualitative
 
assessments
.
2) 
Determine
 
the
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
criteria
.

of
 
paired
 
comparisons
5) 
Choose
 a 
compromise
 
alternative
