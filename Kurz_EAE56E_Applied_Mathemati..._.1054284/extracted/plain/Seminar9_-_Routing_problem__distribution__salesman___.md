training
 
sets
 
for
 basic 
operations
 
with
 SMD 
components
The
 
company
 
producing
 
educational
 
sets
 
for
 
high
 
schools
 and 
universities
 
of
 
electrical
 
fields
 and 
fields
 
focused
 on 
industrial
 
automation
 and 
digital
 technology 
produces
 
sets
 
of
 
electronic
 
components
, 
which
 
also
 
includes
 a set 
for
 
mastering
 basic 
operations
 
with
 SMD 
components
. In 
one
 
production
 
cycle
, 
the
 
company
 
can
 
produce
 
three
 
variants
 
of
 
sets
 
for
 
mounting
 SMD 
components
. 
The
 
company
 
is
 
also
 a distributor and 
it
 
is
 
distributing
 
the
 
sets
 
from
 
it’s
 
central
 
storage
 to 
the
 
individual
 
schools
 in Prague.
The
 
distances
 
between
 
the
 
central
 
storate
 and 
individual
 
schools
 in 
kilometers
, and 
the
 
requirements
 
of
 
 
individual
 
schools
 in 
pieces
 
of
 
teaching
 
sets
 are 
shown
 in 
the
 
following
 
tables
. 
The
 
company
 has 
only
 
two
 
vehicles
 
available
, 
each
 
with
 a transport 
capacity
 
of
 800 
teaching
 
sets
.

Tasks
:
Design 
the
 most 
advantageous
 
path
 
of
 
the
 
drill
 
head
 
using
 
the
 Vogel 
approximation
 
method
 so 
that
 
the
 
total
 
time
 
required
 to 
drill
 
all
 
the
 
holes
 in 
the
 
printed
 
circuit
 
board
 
is
 as 
short
 as 
possible
*
printed
 
circuit
 
board
 
is
 
used
 in 
electronics
 
for
 
mechanical
 
attachment
 and 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time
 
for
 
electrical
 
connection
 
of
 
electronic
 
components
. 
The
 
components
 are 
connected
 by 
conductive
 
paths
, 
joints
 
created
 by 
etching
 
from
 
copper
 
foils
 
glued
 on 
an
 
insulating
 
laminate
 
board
 (
glass
 
laminate
, 
clad
 
with
 
copper
 
foil
). 
This
 
creates
 
insulating
 
gaps
 
between
 
the
 
joints
. 
The
 
components
 
themselves
 are 
soldered
 to 
the
 PCB 
behind
 
their
 
terminals
 
with
 
tin
 
solder
. 
Classic
 
designs
 
of
 
components
 
have
 
terminals
 in 
the
 
form
 
of
 
wires
 
or
 
pins
. These are 
usually
 
pushed
 
through
 
the
 
holes
 in 
the
 PCB and on 
the
 
opposite
 
side
 
of
 
the
 
component
, 
they
 are 
soldered
 to 
the
 
connections
 made by 
the
 
copper
 
layer
.
