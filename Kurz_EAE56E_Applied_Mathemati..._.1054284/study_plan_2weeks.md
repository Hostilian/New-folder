Study plan — Applied Mathematics for IT (EAE56E)

Assumptions
- Exam is in 2 weeks from Oct 23, 2025 (target window: Oct 24  Nov 6, 2025).
- You can study 3 hours every day (I used this to re-balance the plan).

Quick summary of exam and assessment (from course pages)
- Assessment: completion of multiple-choice self-tests in Moodle (60%) + final exam (written + oral).
- Written exam format: 3 theoretical questions, 2 small examples, 2 large examples. If the written test score <50% student must re-sit written part and cannot sit the oral exam.
- Allowed tools: plain paper, pens, ruler, non-programmable calculator and explicitly permitted documents only.

High‑priority topics to cover (from syllabus, lectures & seminars)
- Linear algebra: vector spaces, matrix operations, systems of linear equations, elimination methods
- Linear optimisation: simplex algorithm, post‑optimality analysis, duality
- Transportation and distribution models: Vogel's approximation, MODI method
- Multiple objective/criteria decision making: AHP, multiple‑attribute decision models
- Game theory and matrix games
- Decision models (games against nature, EMV/EOL, decision trees)

- Lecture slides: Soubor_Lecture_-_Decision_models (P10_AMI_DecisionModels*.ppt), Soubor_Lecture_-_Matrix_games, Soubor_Lecture_-_Vehicle_route, etc.
- Study questions: SQ10.docx (Game Theory), SQ11.docx (Decision Models), SQ12.docx (Multiple Criteria)
- Seminars & worked examples: Soubor_Examples_from..., Soubor_Solution_of_selected_cases_.1054596, Soubor_Seminar_* and Test_Small_test_for_practice_* files
- Moodle self tests: check the SELF_TEST files and the Moodle course page; do self-tests early to lock 60% credit portion.

Daily plan (14 days) — adjusted to 3 hours/day

Week 1  Build foundation and start practicing (days D1..D7)

  - Start transportation problem (Vogel) and compute initial solution (60 min).

- D7  Transportation (MODI) + distribution examples (3h)
  - Complete MODI method for 2 examples (150 min).
  - Quick review notes and checklist (30 min).

Week 2  Apply, practice full exam format, and revise (D8..D14)
- D8  Multiple criteria decision making (AHP) (3h)
  - Read SQ12 and perform pairwise comparisons; compute weights for 2 examples (120 min).
  - Interpret results and sensitivity (60 min).

- D9  Game theory: matrix games, strategies, saddle points (3h)
  - Study SQ10 and solve 3 matrix game examples (150 min).
  - Make quick reference notes (30 min).

- D10  Decision models & decision trees (3h)
  - Practice EMV/EOL and decision-tree examples (120 min).
  - Rework one larger decision model (60 min).

- D11  Mixed practice (3h)
  - Solve one problem from each topic under timed segments (90 min).
  - Simulate written exam: 3 short theory answers (3045 min) + 2 small examples (3045 min).

- D12  Full mock written exam + Moodle self-tests (3h)
  - Take a 120-min mock written exam (3 theory + 2 small + 2 large) (120 min).
  - Grade & review mistakes (60 min). If Moodle self-tests need completion, do them after or the next day.

- D13  Review weak points & oral prep (3h)
  - Rework all mistakes from D12 (120 min).
  - Oral prep: prepare 6 concise answers and practice aloud (60 min).

- D14  Final quick review & logistics (3h)
  - One-page cheat-sheet finalization and short practice (90 min).
  - Check exam rules, ID, materials and rest plan (90 min).

Notes on timing and priorities
- If you have more study time, move more practice problems into D1–D6; practice is higher return than rereading slides.
- If your Moodle self-tests are not yet completed, do them early (ideally on D12 but earlier if you need the 60% credit secured). If completion is required for eligibility, prioritize them now.
- Focus on understanding the process for solving optimisation problems (set up, tableau, pivot, interpret) — exam often tests procedure and interpretation.

Exam day checklist
- ID (identity card / passport / driving licence) — required.
- Pens, ruler, non‑programmable calculator.
- Printed cheat‑sheet (if allowed) or one-page handwritten summary for revision beforehand.
- Turn off phone, put it in bag.

Quick practice templates
- Written exam mock: 3 short theory questions (definition + short derivation), 2 short examples (one simplex step each), 2 long examples (full simplex or transportation problem).
- Oral prep: bullet answers for definitions (duality, slack/surplus, Vogel, MODI, AHP steps, Nash equilibrium, EMV/EOL).

Next steps I can do for you (pick any)
1) Adapt this plan to your exact available hours per day.
2) Generate 3 mock written exams (with solutions) from the course slides and study questions.
3) Extract practice problems from the seminar solution files and prepare step‑by‑step solutions.

Good luck — tell me which next step you want and if you want the plan adjusted to different daily hours or the exact exam date/time.
