(Placeholder) I will compile a 30â€“50 question MCQ bank per course. Tell me if you prefer:
- Moodle XML export
- CSV for manual import
- Plain markdown quiz for quick drilling

For Applied Mathematics I will extract MCQs from `Test_Small_test_for_practice_..._.1054523` and Self_test files and then synthesize additional ones from `SQ10-12`.
