Credit exam prep — Applied Mathematics (10 days)

Goal: pass the Moodle credit test (10 days). Focus: quick MCQ-style recall + short computations.

Key resources (local):
- `extracted/plain/SQ10.md`, `extracted/plain/SQ11.md`, `extracted/plain/SQ12.md` (study questions)
- `Oblast_textu_a_mdi_SELF_TEST_..._.1054609/index.html` and `Test_Small_test_for_practice_..._.1054523/index.html` (practice tests)
- `Soubor_Topics_for_exam_.1054620/content/AMI_organisation/P12_AMI_Topics2012.pptx` (topic list)
- Lecture slides under `Soubor_Lecture_*` (P1,P3,P8,P9,P10,P11,P12 etc.) and recorded video links `URL_Video_of_the_lecture_*.index.html`.

Daily plan (approx 1–1.5 hours/day focused on MCQ + 1.5 hours on quick worked examples):
Day 1: Syllabus & topics skim. Read `P12_AMI_Topics2012.pptx` (topic list). Do Self_test_1 specimen.
Day 2: Linear algebra basics — vector spaces, matrix ops. Read slides P1 & P3. Solve 5 short problems from `SQ11`.
Day 3: Systems of linear equations & Gaussian elimination — practice with S1-style problems from `extracted/plain/SQ11.md`.
Day 4: LP basics & simplex ideas — review P3/P10 slides and topic list. Do 3 small simplex examples.
Day 5: Transportation models (Vogel/MODI) — review Seminar 9 materials and `Seminar9 - Routing problem` docx (extracted). Practice 1 transportation problem.
Day 6: Game theory (matrix games) — read `SQ10.md` and P9 slides, practice 2 mixed-strategy MCQs.
Day 7: Decision analysis (EMV, EOL, decision trees) — review URLs and P10 Decision Models slides, practice 1 decision-tree problem.
Day 8: Multiple criteria (AHP) — review P11 MCDM slides and pairwise comparison links, compute one 3×3 priority vector.
Day 9: Quick mixed review — run through all Self_tests and Test_Small_test_for_practice HTML pages; time yourself.
Day 10: Mock credit test — simulate 30–45 minute MCQ session using compiled MCQs (I can export this for Moodle if you want).

Exam-day checklist
- 8–10 minute cheatsheet review (AMI_cheatsheet_onepage.md). Focus on formulas and algorithm steps.
- Do 10 rapid MCQs to warm up.

How I can help next:
- Convert Self_tests and Test_Small_test_for_practice to a timed MCQ file (CSV/XML).
- Generate 20 targeted MCQs for daily drilling (I can produce these automatically).
