Credit exam prep — Human-Computer Interaction (10 days)

Goal: prepare for credit test (likely MCQ + short answers) in 10 days. Focus: usability principles, prototyping, testing methods.

Key resources:
- Lecture slides and labs: `Soubor_LA B_1_.1221930\content\HCI1.pptx`, `Soubor_LA B_2_-_Paper_prototype_.1234040` (HCI LAB 2.pptx)
- Readings and URLs: multiple `URL_Lecture_*` index.html items and `Sloka_prototype_.1234602` sample site.

10-day plan:
Day 1: Syllabus & major models of HCI; skim Lecture 1 slides.
Day 2: Usability heuristics and principles (Lecture 8 UI testing). Practice MCQs.
Day 3: Paper prototyping methods and labs (LAB 2). Do 1 small design exercise.
Day 4: Usability testing methods & metrics — read Hong_long_UsabilityStudy.pdf.
Day 5: Interaction design patterns and examples (URL and lecture slides).
Day 6: Prototyping tools (Draw IO), review sample prototype pages.
Day 7: Timed MCQ practice and short answer recall.
Day 8: Work through lab assignments and prepare answers.
Day 9: Mock credit test + review
Day 10: Final quick recap and cheat-sheet.

I can convert lecture slides into 30 targeted MCQs for timed practice and create short flashcards for usability heuristics.
