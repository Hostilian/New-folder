Credit exam prep — Ceske (10 days)

Note: folder `ceske` contains `sylabus` and `isczu`. I assume this is a language or Czech-related course. If I guessed wrong, tell me.

10-day plan (focus on basics & MCQs):
Day 1: Open syllabus in `ceske/sylabus` and identify credit topics.
Day 2: Vocabulary & grammar core topics — create 30 flashcards.
Day 3: Reading comprehension practice — read 2 short texts in `ceske/ceske` or `englishceske`.
Day 4: Practice MCQs if present in `isczu` export.
Day 5: Listening / pronunciation practice if audio links exist.
Day 6: Timed MCQ practice + review.
Day 7: Grammar drills and error correction.
Day 8: Short writing practice (1 paragraph + corrections).
Day 9: Mock credit test (timed) from compiled MCQs.
Day 10: Final review and cheat-sheet.

If you want, I can scan `ceske/isczu` for explicit quizzes and extract them into a practice set.
