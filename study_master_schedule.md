Consolidated master 14-day schedule (3 hours/day) for all courses

Rules:
- You have 3 hours/day total. We will rotate focus across courses so each gets prioritized time before exams.
- Credit prep (10 days) takes precedence in the first 10 days for all courses (short MCQ sessions daily).

Suggested daily blocks (each day = 3 hours):
- Block A (1.0h): Credit test MCQ drilling for one course (timed 30–45 minutes + review)
- Block B (1.0h): Focused topic study (reading slides, short problem) for the same or next priority course
- Block C (1.0h): Practice problems / worked examples or short mock questions

14-day rotation example (start Day 1 = today):
Day 1: AMI credit warmup (A), AMI LP basics (B), DB DDL practice (C)
Day 2: DB credit warmup (A), CBS OOP concepts (B), HCI heuristics (C)
Day 3: CBS credit warmup (A), AMI linear algebra practice (B), ENE quiz practice (C)
Day 4: HCI credit warmup (A), DB joins practice (B), AMI transport problems (C)
Day 5: ENE credit warmup (A), CBS patterns (B), HCI prototyping (C)
Day 6: AMI credit warmup (A), DB transactions (B), CES vocab drills (C)
Day 7: DB credit warmup (A), AMI game theory (B), CBS unit testing (C)
Day 8: CBS credit warmup (A), HCI usability testing (B), ENE timed quiz (C)
Day 9: HCI credit warmup (A), AMI mocks (B), DB mock practice (C)
Day 10: ENE credit warmup (A), CES mock practice (B), AMI final review (C)
Day 11-14: Use the two final days for full AMI mocks and oral prep plus catch-up for any course you feel weak in. Keep the structure of A/B/C blocks.

Notes & tips:
- Start each study day with the 10–15 minute MCQ credit warmup (Block A) for whichever course the plan assigns.
- Keep a single cheat-sheet per course (two-sided) and review it in the last 15 minutes of the day.
- I can generate timed MCQ banks for each course and a daily email-style study reminder if you want.
